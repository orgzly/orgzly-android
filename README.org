* Orgzly

Orgzly is an outliner for taking notes and managing to-do lists.

You can keep notebooks stored in plain-text and have them synchronized
with a directory on your mobile device, SD card or Dropbox.

Notebooks are saved in /Org mode/'s file format. “Org mode is for
keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and
authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.” See
http://orgmode.org for more information.
